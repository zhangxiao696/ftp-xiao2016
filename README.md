# ftp-xiao2016
Set up a small ftp server in  Linux environment

hello,world.

This project is a small FTP server,and it is modeled on the vsftpd server in Linux environment.This server uses the logical structure of the three processes,and there is a primary process, a service process, a worker process.Have a say is that service process is responsible for process control and data connections,and worker process helpes establish a data connection between the client.

This is my first time to submit code on github,and please understand the imperfections.Of course, I also welcome to modify the project to make it better.

Have a good day.
